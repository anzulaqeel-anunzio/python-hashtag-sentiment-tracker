# Social Media Hashtag Sentiment Tracker (Python)

A Python script to track public posts containing specific hashtags and analyze their sentiment using data scraping and NLP.

> [!NOTE]
> This project uses a mock scraper to generate sample social media posts for demonstration. Real-time scraping of platforms like Twitter/X requires expensive APIs or complex authenticated scraping, which is outside the scope of this educational tool.

## Features

-   **Mock Scraper**: Simulates fetching posts for a hashtag.
-   **Sentiment Analysis**: Uses `TextBlob` to score sentiment (Polarity: -1 to +1).
-   **Reporting**: key metrics like average sentiment and positive/negative ratio.

## Installation

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
